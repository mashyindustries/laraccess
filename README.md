# Associate users with roles

This package allows to save roles in a database.
Roles can inherit other roles too.

It includes blade directives & middleware

## Install

You can install the package via composer:
``` bash
$ composer require spatie/laravel-permission
```

This service provider must be installed.
```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the migration with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

The package assumes that your users table name is called "users". If this is not the case
you should manually edit the published migration to use your custom table name.

After the migration has been published you can create the role- and permission-tables by
running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config-file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

First add the `Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles`-trait to your User model.

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasRoles;
    
    // ...
}
```

This package allows for users to be associated with roles. Permissions can be associated with roles.
A `Role` and a `Permission` are regular Eloquent-models. They can have a name and can be created like this:

```php
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

$role = Role::create(['name' => 'writer']);
$permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);
```

The `HasRoles` adds eloquent relationships to your models, which can be accessed directly or used as a base query.

```php
$permissions = $user->permissions;
$roles = $user->roles()->pluck('name'); // returns a collection
```

The `HasRoles` also adds a scope to your models to scope the query to certain roles.

```php
$users = User::role('writer')->get(); // Only returns users with the role 'writer'
```
The scope can accept a string, a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Role`-object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection`-object.

###Using permissions
A permission can be given to a user:

```php
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

//you can also give multiple permission at once
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles', 'delete articles');

//you may also pass an array
$user->givePermissionTo(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

A permission can be revoked from a user:

```php
$user->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

You can test if a user has a permission:
```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Saved permissions will be registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate`-class. So you can
test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can`-function.
```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

###Using roles and permissions
A role can be assigned to a user:

```php
$user->assignRole('writer');

// you can also assign multiple roles at once
$user->assignRole('writer', 'admin');
$user->assignRole(['writer', 'admin']);
```

A role can be removed from a user:

```php
$user->removeRole('writer');
```

Roles can also be synced :

```php
//all current roles will be removed from the user and replace by the array given
$user->syncRoles(['writer', 'admin']);
```

You can determine if a user has a certain role:

```php
$user->hasRole('writer');
```

You can also determine if a user has any of a given list of roles:
```php
$user->hasAnyRole(Role::all());
```
You can also determine if a user has all of a given list of roles:

```php
$user->hasAllRoles(Role::all());
```

The `assignRole`, `hasRole`, `hasAnyRole`, `hasAllRoles`  and `removeRole`-functions can accept a
 string, a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Role`-object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection`-object.

A permission can be given to a role:

```php
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```


You can determine if a role has a certain permission:

```php
$role->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

A permission can be revoked from a role:

```php
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

The `givePermissionTo` and `revokePermissionTo`-functions can accept a 
string or a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission`-object.

Saved permission and roles are also registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate`-class.
```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

###Using blade directives
This package also adds Blade directives to verify whether the
currently logged in user has all or any of a given list of roles.

```php
@role('writer')
I'm a writer!
@else
I'm not a writer...
@endrole
```

```php
@hasrole('writer')
I'm a writer!
@else
I'm not a writer...
@endhasrole
```

```php
@hasanyrole(Role::all())
I have one or more of these roles!
@else
I have none of these roles...
@endhasanyrole
```

```php
@hasallroles(Role::all())
I have all of these roles!
@else
I don't have all of these roles...
@endhasallroles
```

You can use Laravel's native `@can` directive to check if a user has a certain permission.

## Using a middleware
The package doesn't contain a middleware to check permissions but it's very trivial to add this yourself.

``` bash
$ php artisan make:middleware RoleMiddleware
```

This will create a RoleMiddleware for you, where you can handle your role and permissions check.
```php
// app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php
use Auth;

...

public function handle($request, Closure $next, $role, $permission)
{
    if (Auth::guest()) {
        return redirect($urlOfYourLoginPage);
    }

    if (! $request->user()->hasRole($role)) {
       abort(403);
    }
    
    if (! $request->user()->can($permission)) {
       abort(403);
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```

Don't forget to add the route middleware to your Kernel:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    ...
    'role' => \App\Http\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
    ...
];
```

Now you can protect your routes using the middleware you just set up:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:admin,access_backend']], function () {
    //
});
```

## Extending

If you need to extend or replace the existing `Role` or `Permission` models you just need to 
keep the following things in mind:

- Your `Role` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Role` contract
- Your `Permission` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Permission` contract
- You must publish the configuration with this command: `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"` and update the `models.role` and `models.permission` values
